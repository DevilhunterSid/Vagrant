These are the main file to run the Box. As of now this support only VirtualBox. In the near future I will try to create for other hypervisors as well.

1) Copy the contents to the default location, where your virtualbox gets provisioned when you install a OS.
2) After placing it in the directory. Hit Vagrant up, this will bring up the Box.
3) Default SSH login is 127.0.0.1. Keep an eye on the port number, when you hit vagrant up, it displays everything. [You can change it using vagrantfile --But be sure what you are doing]
4) Username and Password are both Vagrant. I have kept it as default, feel free to change if you like.

NOTE:1) This require GIT tools to be installed on your computer. This was created using GIT. If you use any other tools, I am not responsible for what happens next.
     2) Vagrant need hypervisor to run. I would suggest OVB(Oracle VirtualBox) for this as it is a freeware. Stay tuned i will create for other hypervisors as well.

Thats it folks!!!. Modify and share.
